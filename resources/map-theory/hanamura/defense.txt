Orisa holds on small stairs in front of choke with bap, hanzo right behind and zen back on
smaller high ground left of point (POV looking towards choke from point). Sig/ashe hold top right high
ground holding top right window/choke with dynamite and rock. In rotation, horse back up
and meet zen to turn to point if touch by tank needed and sig can't  there. Sig and ashe rotate back towards
point, around bell to meet zen. Zen can play high ground as well with bap.

Point B
Orisa holds top left doorwar with all dps but hanzo. Hanzo holds top right high ground or catwalk
with sigma. Assuming a top left push, sig pokes until drop to point with hanzo, then rotate
back upstairs to help tanks, horse is second touch.
