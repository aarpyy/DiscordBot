Point A
TP straight to point, rein holds choke and bap sits on stairs, focus is on letting sym and rein take control.
For subsequent fights, TP to top left highground and hold until a pick. For dps swaps, go to cass/reaper.

Point B
If still on sym, mei: rush top right using mei wall and ults to take high ground. Use TP to  to top of
point so that anyone can hold that. D.va drops to contest/force point, sym and rein follow. If on reaper/cass,
rush top right but cass and d.va take bridge and look to poke in a pincer style. Swap to monkey here if needed.
